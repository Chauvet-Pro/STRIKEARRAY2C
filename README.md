* Place the .chl file in the root directory of the USB drive.
* The product's USB port supports up to 32GB capacity and only works with FAT32 file format.
* Turning off the power or removing the USB while still blinking during the update will cause partial or total firmware failure in the targeted fixture(s). A force upload will be needed to fix firmware failure issues.

4.	Go to Upgrade Firmware on the menu map.
5.	Choose between **Multiple Fixture** and **Other Fixture Type**. Press **< ENTER >**.
      * **Multiple Fixture** : Both the target fixture and main fixture are from the same product line (e.g., 2 Color STRIKE M fixtures).
      * **Other Fixture Type**: The target fixture and main fixture are from different product series (e.g., a Color STRIKE M as the target fixture and a Maverick Silens 2 Profile as the main fixture).
6.	Select the file that needs to be uploaded. The message ***“Are you sure?”*** will appear on the screen. Press **< ENTER >**. Turn on the target fixture within 1–2 seconds of pressing **< ENTER >**. The display on the target fixture should remain off.
      a. The main fixture will show the update progress (0–100%).
      b. The target fixture’s display will turn on, and a notification ***“< UPDATE >”*** will appear on the screen.
7.	DO NOT turn off power or remove the USB flash drive. Once the software is done uploading, the target fixture will automatically reboot.
8.	Go to the target fixture’s main menu and confirm that the firmware version has been updated.
9.	Reboot the target fixture.

### Special Notes
* A Force Upload process requires a target fixture (the fixture that needs a Force Upload and a main fixture (the fixture that controls the upload process).
* The Force Upload process can only be done one target fixture at a time.
